Introduction

IMPre - predict BCR and TCR germline V/J genes and alleles using deep-sequencing data for rearrangement repertoire. It utilizes Clust_Seed algorithm to classify sequences and de-novel assembly for extension. V and J gene/allele are inferred seperately. FASTA format is required.

######################
System Requirement

It runs on 64-bit Linux systems.  If takes 1E6 sequences as input for example, about maximum 2.5Gb memory would be required.
Perl and C need to be installed for you system.

######################
Installation

   1. Before use it, perl(https://www.perl.org/get.html) need to be installed. 
   2. The 'Graph' module is required for the perl version.
   3. The system for C program is required.
   4. Download the IMPre to your directory, uncompress it.
   5. Make sure all programs are executable: (go to the direcotry IMPre)
   	chmod 555 *
	chmod 555 Annotation/*
	chmod 755 Test

Usage

   1. Create shell
   perl IMPre.pl 
	Compulsory: for sequence include C region, -i -o -n -p; for others (sequence with plus strand), -i -o -n
	Optionally: others
	all the parameters have the detail introduction if you run "perl IMPre.pl"
   this step will create multiple directory and shells

	[parameters]

		   ****    Annotation     *************
	    -known  <S> Known germline sequences file. uesd for annotation. FASTA format(the id should be like this: germline_name_flag_specie, such as TRBV1-1*01_F_Human)
	    -re_v   <I> To recommend a gene name, V gene mismatch number allowed for clustering [7]
	    -re_j   <I> To recommend a gene name, J gene mismatch number allowed for clustering [5]

Note
            1. If the sequence including C region, the compulsory parameters: -i -o -n -p
            2. If the sequence without C region, the sequence must be forward strand and the compulsory parameters: -i -o -n
	    3. -known: inferred germline would be aligned to the provided known germline sequences. Actually, IMPre will align all inferred germline to Human and Mouse known germline sequences with default.So "-known+Human+Mouse" will be used for annotation
            4. There are lots of parameters, however, almost of them are not need to reset, just using the values by recommendation.


   2. Run shell
   2.1 it can easy to run the general sh 'Execute_all.sh': sh Execute_all.sh
   2.2 run multiple shells in seperately,so V/J could be run in parallel.
   	sh *_data_processing.sh
	sh *_J_clustering.sh
	sh *_V_clustering.sh
	sh *_J_assembly.sh
	sh *_J_optimization.sh
	sh *_V_assembly.sh
	sh *_V_optimization.sh
	sh *_annotation.sh
